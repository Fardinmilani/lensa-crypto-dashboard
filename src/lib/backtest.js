//
// Optional, off by default. When enabled, this scans each open trade for an
// intrabar breach of a max-loss or max-gain percentage (checked against the
// bar's low/high, not just its close, since a stop can be hit and recover
// within the same candle) and forces an exit at that bound — but only as a
// CEILING/FLOOR. If the strategy's own exit signal would have closed the
// trade earlier, at a smaller profit or loss than the configured bound,
// that earlier signal exit is respected as-is; this overlay never holds a
// position open longer than the strategy says to, it only ever closes it
// *sooner*, before price can run further in either direction.
//
// Implemented as a signal-array transform (rather than inside each engine's
// accounting loop) so the exact same logic applies uniformly to the spot
// engine (runBacktest, long-only) and the leveraged engine
// (runLeveragedBacktest, long/short with leverage): both engines already
// just replay whatever 0/1 or -1/0/1 signal they're given, so forcing an
// early flip to 0 here is equivalent to the strategy itself having signalled
// the exit on that bar.
//
// `riskParams`: { stopLossPercent, takeProfitPercent } — either or both may
// be omitted/null to disable that side independently. Percentages are
// always interpreted as a magnitude (e.g. stopLossPercent: 2 means "exit if
// the position is down 2%", not literally -2).
//
// Returns { signals, exitPrice }. `exitPrice[i]` holds the exact stop/target
// price on any bar where this overlay forced an exit, or null otherwise.
// This matters because a forced exit can happen mid-bar (the low/high
// pierced the bound while the close did not) — if the caller just used that
// bar's close price to fill the trade, a single large-range candle could
// report a P/L far beyond the configured stop-loss percentage, which is
// exactly backwards for a risk control. Filling at the configured bound
// instead (as a real stop/limit order would, ignoring slippage) is what
// keeps a trade's realized loss capped at stopLossPercent as configured.
